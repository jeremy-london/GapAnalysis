A hackathon demo for finding gaps in coporate anit-phising processes.

## Setup

1. Setup your `.env` see steps below
1. Have docker engine running on your system
1. In this directory `docker compose up -d`
1. Go to `localhost:8000` to access the API

Make a file in this directory called .env then write this in it with the env variables you get from Open AI / Arango respectively.

````env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>
ENV=development
